# UI/UX Engineer

## Role

Responsible for all frontend implementation, user experience design, and client-side interaction.

## Tech Stack

- Nuxt 3 (Vue 3)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn-vue

## Responsibilities

- Build pages, layouts, and components
- Implement conversational UI flows for project creation (clarifying questions, speech-to-text input)
- Build calendar views for scheduling
- Create shopping list and materials management interfaces
- Handle client-side state management
- Build vertical slices — each feature delivered as a complete frontend unit (components, composables, pages)

## Guidelines

- Use shadcn-vue for UI primitives — don't reinvent buttons, dialogs, inputs, etc.
- Use Vue composables for shared logic across components
- Place reusable components in a shared directory — never duplicate across features
- TypeScript strict mode — no `any` types
- Mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind
- Accessible and intuitive interfaces
